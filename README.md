# 🌏📗 GIS-Drone-and-Machine-Learning-for-Resource-Mapping-QGIS-Week-3 🗾
# 🇮🇳 QGIS India's Geospatial Data Project

# 🌍 Project Overview
In Week 3 of this project, we zoomed into the West Zone of India, specifically targeting the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra. The aim was to perform a detailed sub-regional analysis, down to the district level, and integrate advanced terrain data using open-source GIS tools.
This step prepares the foundation for resource mapping using drone imagery and machine learning algorithms in later stages.

🔍 Objective
- To focus on zonal-level resource mapping.
- To extract and visualize district-level data from Gujarat and Maharashtra.
- To integrate high-resolution elevation data using Mapzen Global Terrain.
- To prepare the terrain data for use in drone analysis and ML classification.
